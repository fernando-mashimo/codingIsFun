A few random coding challenges I took - only for mental health purposes :).

- calcula_MMC.js: calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integer numbers;
- calculatePI.js: calculates a proxy of Pi by means of a very simplistic approach;
- leetCode_Roman2Numbers.js: convert a number written in Roman to Hindu-Arabic numerals.

I expect to grow this repo as time goes by...
